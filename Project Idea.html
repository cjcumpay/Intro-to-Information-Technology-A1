<h1 style="font-family: 'brush script mt'; margin-left: 10px;"> Project Idea </h1>
<p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 20px;">My project idea is a nutritional app that shows simple recipes that the user can cook based on what is currently in their kitchen. This app is more aimed towards those who has goals in terms of their body and health as users enter their necessary details at the start for the app to personalise their meals, the app then prioritises the recipes that fit their dietary needs depending on what details the user puts in the start-up of the app. The aim of this app is for helping users to achieve their goals by providing recipes that is affordable as the ingredients for the recipe would already be in their kitchen.
This project will be interesting as it solves multiple everyday problems for individuals who tend to live a healthy life, such as not knowing what to cook, not being able to afford the foods as well as not knowing nutritional information is in home cooked meals. Personally, this app would be efficient as I would be able to keep track of what foods goes in my body and provide recipes for me that is affordable and easily accessible, which would allow me to reach my goals and ultimately be healthier.
</p>
<p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 20px;">
This nutritional app aims to increase efficiency in achieving usersâ€™ goals through their diets. Users must first enter details including age, height, weight, activity levels during the week and goals. The app then informs them of their current health by telling them their BMI (Body Mass Index) and instructs user on what to do to achieve their goal, the app then personalises the recipes based on the user. For example, a user who might be considered obese is looking to lose weight. The user makes an account in the app and enters their details on the app and will then be told that in order to lose weight, they must partake in a calorie deficit and informs the user the limit in how much calories they can put in their body in a day, also recommending recipes that are low in calories for that one specific user, as opposed to a user wanting to gain mass. The mass gaining user must do the same initial setup and will then be informed that they will need to do calorie surplus, again, the app tells them the recommended calorie intake for each day before providing them meals that are high in calories so that the user achieves his goal of gaining muscle mass. Once the initial set up of account has been complete, users can simply enter the contents of their kitchen and with that information, the app searches for recipes that include the entered ingredients, and the results are shown to the user. The results of the recipe will differ in users as due to the information that was given to the app by the customers. Different recipes will be prioritised on top of the list of the results depending on the dietary needs, for example, someone who needs to do calorie deficit would have low calorie meals be on top of their results list while someone who is doing calorie surplus would have the high caloric meals on top of theirs. The users also have the option to register their weight on the app every week so that they can record their progress weekly.
</p>
<p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 20px;">
In order to create this app, coding must be written using Python. A mobile device will also be needed for constant testing of the application.
</p>
<p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 20px;">
Though my skills at this time is very limited due to inexperience and lack of knowledge within the IT world, this course would increase my skills and thus, making the creation of this app possible. The software needed is feasible as it is already owned so therefore this application could be feasible if ample time is given during the production of this process.
</p>
<p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 20px;">
If the project is successful, then users of this app would fulfil their goals in achieving their health and body through their healthy living. It would solve multiple problems faced by those who are trying to live healthily on a budget as well as provide ideas for those who do not know what meals to cook and wish to change up their food without halting their progress towards their goal. If successful, the impact of this app has the possibility to assist, and hopefully encourage, individuals to live a healthier life.
